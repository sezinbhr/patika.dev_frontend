    <h3>About me</h3>
    <!--this one is middle one, it has still an importance but not much like h2 tag-->
    <p>Hi! I'm Bahar Sezin. I have a keen interest to literature and learning new languages. It's really inspiring that
        reading books about human pyschology, also learning different things about a culture while studying a new
        language. Currently I'm studying on web development, as well. Through the kodluyoruz.org and patika.dev, I'm
        learning new things about how to web pages work, and this is my first web page for this particular journey. </p>

    <h2>The most mind-blowing book I've ever read</h2>
    <!--this one is the second most important header-->
    <h3>One, No one and One hundred thousand ones by Luigi Pirandello</h3>
    <p>This novel is not an easy read. However, whenever you find yourself not understanding, there will be something
        further ahead telling you that you are on the right path. I don't want to give any spoilers about the book, the
        book was all about perceptions and perspectives. </p>
    <!--It is may written the real content of the web page between the paragraph tags-->
    <p>It's a very well-written book about human pyschology and also
        if you choose to read that, you will be very enlighted about that how do you perceive yourself even though you
        have nobody around you.</p>,
